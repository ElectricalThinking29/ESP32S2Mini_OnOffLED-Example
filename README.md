- ~~Step 2: Make sure you have already installed CP210x Driver.~~ _Actually you don't need to do this step. I have confirmed that in my recent video [here](https://youtu.be/PTaIUJnYurg)_
- Step 3: Load the program to ESP32 for the first time: On VS Code (PlatformIO's Home Window), create the project with board: WEMOS LOLIN S2 Mini
